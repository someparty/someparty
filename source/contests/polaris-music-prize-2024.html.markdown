## The 2024 Polaris Music Prize Short List

This year's contenders for the Polaris Prize include:

* BAMBII — *INFINITY CLUB*
* The Beaches — *Blame My Ex*
* Charlotte Cardin — *99 Nights*
* DijahSB — *The Flower That Knew*
* Jeremy Dutcher — *Motewolonuwok*

The Polaris Music Prize, presented by [CBC Music](https://www.cbc.ca/music), awards the artist who creates the Canadian Album of the Year, judged solely on artistic merit, without consideration for genre or record sales. An 11-member Grand Jury votes on the winner. That group is a subset of the broader Polaris juror pool of more than 200 members. That cohort includes writers, broadcasters, bloggers, and other media authorities from all corners of the Canadian music spectrum. It also includes me, which is undoubtedly an oversight as I am an authority on very little.

## About the Gala

Confirmed performers for this year's event include Charlotte Cardin, Jeremy Dutcher, BAMBII, Elisapie, DijahSB, NOBRO, TOBi, with a special performance by Beaches vocalist Jordan Miller backed by The Thunder Queens. That lineup is subject to change as the date approaches.
