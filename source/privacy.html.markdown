I require your email address so I can send you this newsletter. That's it.

I have no use for your email otherwise. You won't receive unsolicited marketing junk from me, or anyone I'm affiliated with, as a result of you subscribing to Some Party.

[Tiny Letter](http://tinyletter.com), a lightweight mailing list service owned by [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/), distributes the Some Party newsletter and houses the subscriber list. They have a detailed [privacy policy](http://tinyletter.com/site/legal/privacy/) of their own that explains how their system handles recipient emails (look for the "[Privacy for Contacts](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/#3._Privacy_for_Contacts)" section). MailChimp is owned by Intuit.

In short, they say they also won't sell your email address or utilize that information for anything other than the operation of the email list.

You're free to unsubscribe from Some Party at any time. You're also free to avoid touching the 3rd party email service entirely by using the [Some Party RSS feed](/feed.xml) to roll your own. The contents of every newsletter will be shared there in full.

The source code for Some Party is published at [GitHub](https://github.com/someparty/someparty) and is available under an [MIT license](https://github.com/someparty/someparty/blob/main/LICENSE). GitHub is a subsidiary of Microsoft.

Bands and labels rely on third-party companies to host audio and video. It's possible that some of the services I share media from (YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Vimeo, etc.) may include traffic measurement or tracking cookie mechanisms in their embedded media players. YouTube may also display advertising in their media player. Install an ad blocker or use a privacy-friendly web browser like Firefox if you're concerned about that sort of thing.

This website does no longer utilizes a traffic measurement service and as such should set no cookies of its own.
