I require your email address so I can send you this newsletter. That's it. I have no use for it otherwise and you won't be sent marketing material by myself, or anyone I'm affiliated with, as a result of you subscribing to Some Party.

The Some Party newsletter is distributed by [Tiny Letter](http://tinyletter.com), a lightweight mailing list service owned by [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/). They have a detailed [privacy policy](http://tinyletter.com/site/legal/privacy/) of their own that details how they use the subscriber emails collected.

In short, they say they also won't sell your email address or utilize that information for anything other than the operation of the email list.

You're free to unsubscribe from Some Party at any time. You're also free to avoid touching the 3rd party email service by using the [Some Party RSS feed](/feed.xml) to roll your own. The contents of every newsletter will be shared there in full.

The code for Some Party is published at [GitHub](https://github.com/someparty/someparty) and is available under an MIT license.

Bands and labels rely on third-party companies to host audio and video. It's likely that any of the services I share media from (YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo, etc) include some traffic measurement mechanism in their embedded media players. YouTube may also have advertising in their media player.

The only other third-party service used here is Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics. My feelings won't be hurt if you block those on your end, but if you do please say "hi" once in a while so I know that someone's reading this.
