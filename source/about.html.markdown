Some Party is an online Canadian music publication written and curated by Adam White and based in Niagara Falls, Ontario. This incarnation of the project will take the form of a weekly newsletter, prepared and delivered every Sunday evening on the web and through email.

Back in 2011 and 2012 a nacent version of this project emerged as short lived [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/some-party-punknews.org-ontario/id488545346?mt=2). It may be that again one day.

You can find me on Twitter at [@adamwhite](https://twitter.com/adamwhite) or email [adam@someparty.ca](mailto:adam@someparty.ca).

This project is named after the Constantines song of the same name from their first album. I didn't ask anyone in the band if I could use it, but it means a lot to me so I hope they're cool.
