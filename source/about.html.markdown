Some Party is a newsletter discussing Canadian music. It's written and curated independently by Adam White, who you may know from 20-odd years as a [Punknews.org](https://www.punknews.org) contributor or a [Polaris Music Prize](https://polarismusicprize.ca/) jurist. The newsletter's written and delivered every Sunday evening (or as close to that as I can get).

I named this project after the Constantines song (from their first album). Steve gave me his blessing to call it that, although I admit I asked him years after I started using it. Perhaps he was just being nice.

Some Party's based in Niagara Falls, Ontario, within the lands addressed in Treaty 381. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamwhite), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adamwhite/), and through email at [adam@someparty.ca](mailto:adam@someparty.ca).

##Why Canada?

In 1972 the CBC's Peter Gzowski challenged listeners to complete the saying "as Canadian as..." (a counterpart to "as American as apple pie"). The winning submission, from Heather Scott, read "as Canadian as possible, under the circumstances."

Some Party's mission is similarly dispassionate and ultimately pragmatic. I focus on this county not to celebrate it, but to explore the bonds forged between disparate local music scenes linked by little else than an inconvenient southern border. These are the lines we draw and the connections we make under the circumstances of where we just happen to be.

##Archives

##Acknowledgements

This project couldn't have been launched without the support of [these folks](/acknowledgements/).

Back in 2011 and 2012 a nascent version of this project emerged as a short-lived [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/some-party-punknews.org-ontario/id488545346?mt=2). It may evolve that way again someday. You are actively encouraged to ignore it.
