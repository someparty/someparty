Some Party is a newsletter discussing Canadian music. It's written and curated independently by Adam White, who you may know from 20-odd years as a [Punknews.org](https://www.punknews.org) contributor or as a member of the [Polaris Music Prize](https://polarismusicprize.ca/) jury. The newsletter's written and delivered every Sunday evening (or as close to that as I can get). If you're so inclined, in 2020 I sat down for a fairly in-depth interview on what motivates the project with the folks at [Pentagon Black](https://www.pentagon.black/interviews-vol-ii).

This project couldn't have been launched without the support of [these folks](/acknowledgements/).

Back in 2011 and 2012 a nascent version of this project emerged as a short-lived [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/some-party-punknews.org-ontario/id488545346?mt=2). It may be that again someday. You are actively encouraged to ignore it.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamwhite), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adamwhite/), and through email at [adam@someparty.ca](mailto:adam@someparty.ca).

Some Party's named after a Constantines song from their first album. Steven said it was ok.

Some Party is based in Niagara Falls, Ontario within the lands addressed in Treaty 381.
