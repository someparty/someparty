Some Party is an email newsletter sharing updates on independent Canadian rock music, curated and produced entirely as a solo project by Adam White. You may know me from 20-odd years as a [Punknews.org](https://www.punknews.org) writer and editor or more recently as a [Polaris Music Prize](https://polarismusicprize.ca/) jurist. I compile and deliver the email (more or less) weekly.

I named this project after a Constantines song that addresses the music industry from an outsider's perspective. Steve kindly gave me his retroactive blessing to use the name, not that I gave him much of a choice. Perhaps he was just being nice.

Some Party's based in Niagara Falls, Ontario, within the lands addressed by Treaty 381.

You can find me at my increasingly inactive [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamwhite) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adamwhite/) accounts, or directly through email at [adam@someparty.ca](mailto:adam@someparty.ca). You're free to add me to your mailing lists, PR folk, but note that the mission statement of this publication precludes me from writing about bands from North Dakota and the like.

##Why Canada?

In 1972 the CBC's Peter Gzowski challenged listeners to complete the saying "as Canadian as..." (a counterpart to "as American as apple pie"). The winning submission, from Heather Scott, read "as Canadian as possible, under the circumstances."

Some Party's mission is similarly dispassionate and ultimately pragmatic. I focus on this county not to celebrate it, but to explore the bonds forged between disparate local music scenes linked by little else than an inconvenient southern border. These are the lines we draw and the connections we make under the circumstances of where we just happen to be.

##Acknowledgements

This project couldn't have been launched without the support of [these folks](/acknowledgements/).

In 2011 and 2012, a nascent version of this project emerged as a short-lived Ontario-focused [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/some-party-punknews.org-ontario/id488545346?mt=2) issued through Punknews.org. While I've yet to delete the feed, you are actively encouraged to ignore it.
