Some Party is a newsletter discussing Canadian music. It's written and curated independently by Adam White, who you may know from [Punknews.org](https://www.punknews.org) or as a member of the [Polaris Music Prize](https://polarismusicprize.ca/) jury. The newsletter's written and delivered every Sunday evening on the web and through email.

Back in 2011 and 2012 a nascent version of this project emerged as a short-lived [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/some-party-punknews.org-ontario/id488545346?mt=2). It may be that again someday. You are actively encouraged to ignore the old one.

You can find me on Twitter at [@adamwhite](https://twitter.com/adamwhite) or email at [adam@someparty.ca](mailto:adam@someparty.ca).

This project's named after the Constantines song of the same name from their first album. I never asked anyone in the band if I could use it, but it means a lot to me, so I hope they're cool.

Some Party is based in Niagara Falls, Ontario.
