For better or worse, the [Booji Boys](https://boojiboysfuneral.bandcamp.com/) willfully operate outside the usual PR cycle, and while we knew that *Tube Reducer*, their third full-length, was coming this summer, Friday's arrival still felt like a surprise. With no fanfare and little in the way of pre-release hype, the Halifax punk group quietly shared the 15-song record online at Bandcamp, with a vinyl release not due until late August (it seems like even the band's label is caught playing catch-up on this one). Booji Boys' stubborn sense of DIY is part of their charm though. They operate almost hyper-locally with a whiff of nostalgia for the mailorder days and a less incessantly online life (Bandcamp aside, don't go looking for this on your streaming platform of choice). Sonically, *Tube Reducer* finds the band playing true to form, once again delivering thrillingly blown-out recordings and barely intelligible vocals with subversively hooky songwriting somehow tying all that chaos together.

*Tube Reducer* follows up the band's 2017 Christmas release *Weekend Rocker* and their self-titled debut from earlier that year (both on Drunken Sailor). Along with an occasional home-dubbed cassette, the band's also issued a pair of EPs of the past year years, 2017's *Sweet Boy* on [Cruel Noise Records](https://www.cruelnoiserecords.com/) and the more recent *Unknown Pleathers* 7" on Sewercide.

The band's lineup once again features vocalist Alex Mitchell with guitarists Cody Googoo and Steve Earle, bassist Adam LeDrew, and drummer Justin Crowe. They recorded *Tube Reducer* at Paul's Hall in Glen Haven, Nova Scotia back in February, with LeDrew behind the boards in the studio and spearheading the mix. Luke Mumford of [Negative Rage](https://negativerage.bandcamp.com/) mastered the album.

Speaking of [Sewercide](http://sewerciderecords.blogspot.com/), the label recently announced that they were beginning work on a 7" compilation of east coast Canadian punk and hardcore. Look for it to feature new and exclusive material from the Booji Boys as well as the Charlottetown punk groups [Antibodies](https://antibodieschtn.bandcamp.com/) and [Warsh](http://warsh.bandcamp.com), Halifax D-beat hardcore acts [Fragment](https://fragmentpunk.bandcamp.com) and [Cutie](https://cutie902.bandcamp.com/), Misanthropic Minds (Cody with his [Alienation](https://alienation902.bandcamp.com/) bandmate Dave Brown), and B.P.S. (another shuffling of many of the personnel mentioned above). Sewercide commented:

> "While it's no surprise to us that the DIY punk/hardcore community here has been producing some incredible bands over the years, many haven't been getting the attention they deserve internationally and some don't even get the opportunity to release a record... this will be a small snapshot of what's been going on with punk in our corner of the world and the first time a lot of these bands will be on vinyl."

That record, limited to 300 copies, should be out later this year. *Tube Reducer* arrives on wax in late August from [Drunken Sailor Records](http://www.drunkensailorrecords.co.uk/).

Toronto art-punks [WLMRT](https://wlmrt.bandcamp.com/) have unleashed their first full-length project, a 10-song cassette titled *WLMRT Forever*. You can check the audio now on [Bandcamp](http://wlmrt.bandcamp.com/album/wlmrt-forever) or snag one of the physical copies at the fast-approaching release show on [July 6](https://www.facebook.com/events/904228303256681/) at the Monarch Tavern.

[Tallies](http://tallies.bandcamp.com)' Stephen Pitman produced the new record, with [Telephone Explosion](https://www.telephoneexplosion.com/)'s Steve Sidoli mastering. WLMRT features lead vocalist Shelby Wilson, bassist/vocalist Kat Mcgouran, guitarist Adam Bernhardt, drummer Alex Wood, and Ryan Hage on synths. The album includes several guests appearances, with [Eliza Niemi](https://elizaniemi.bandcamp.com/) of Halifax indie-rock act [Mauno](https://mauno.bandcamp.com/) and Matt Post of Ottawa noise duo [Deathsticks](https://buysomedeathsticks.bandcamp.com) among them.

This is, without doubt, the best WLMRT's sounded on record, and they've achieved that without losing the wild spontaneity that got our attention in the first place. The group's dry, sardonic lyrics, which spill out in a frenzied stream of consciousness from Wilson as the band roils along, are as thrilling as ever. The five-piece is following up their 2018 [Pleasence Records](http://www.pleasencerecords.com/) EP *Lube 2* with this set.

Later this month the band will headline a stage at the inaugural [Side by Side Weekend](https://www.facebook.com/events/377555466159265/permalink/380792492502229/) in Ottawa, playing [Black Squirrel Books](https://www.blacksquirrelbooks.ca/) on Thursday, July 25 with Montreal's [Nüshu](https://nushu.bandcamp.com/) and locals [Flaws](https://flaws613.bandcamp.com) and Bug Bites.

[Listen: WLMRT - *WLMRT Forever* @ Bandcamp](http://wlmrt.bandcamp.com/album/wlmrt-forever "#")

WLMRT's sharing that July 6 release show with two bands, the similarly off-kilter punk group [Hugh Man](https://imhughman.bandcamp.com/) (celebrating their latest EP, *Hughs Man is it Anyway?*), and the return of the hardcore quartet [Sigil](http://sigil.bandcamp.com/). The latter features vocalist Bria Salmena and drummer Kris Bowering, both of the band [FRIGS](https://frigsmusic.com/), along with [Yamantaka // Sonic Titan](http://ytstlabs.com/)'s Brandon Lim and Erik Jude of [Deliluh](https://deliluh.bandcamp.com/). The group's 9-song full-length, titled *Slow Ulcer*, will arrive on cassette for the show.

Sigil's been kicking around for a few years now, stemming from a time when Lim and Jude both played as part of the dark-as-hell sludge punk outfit [HSY](https://hsy666.bandcamp.com/). The DNA of that band's pretty evident here, with *Slow Ulcer* sounding absolutely caustic. Salmena trades the measured and moody vibes of the recent FRIGS record for a thrashing, throat-shredding growl here.

Spirited Saint John rock group [Papal Visit](http://papalvisit.bandcamp.com) released a live EP last week. Titled *Prepare for Your Reversal*, the set was recorded this past March in their hometown. Founded initially as a long-distance recording project by vocalist Adam Mowery and bassist Pierre Cormier (when the former had relocated to Halifax), the band's live lineup has gone through several incarnations. This show, in particular, featured guitarists Chris Braydon and Jason Ogden with drummer Geoffrey Smith. From that group, I'm told, you can connect family tree limbs to a good majority of the city's musical output. This 6-song set features an assortment of cuts from across the band's discography, including their most recent full-length, 2017's *Golden Grove*.

Papal Visit's among the performers slated for this year's [SappyFest](http://www.sappyfest.com/) in Sackville, New Brunswick. Running from August 2 to 4, the event will also feature the likes of [Shotgun Jimmie](https://shotgunjimmie.net/), [Snotty Nose Rez Kids](https://snottynoserezkids.com/), [The Weather Station](http://www.theweatherstation.net/), [Haviah Mighty](https://haviahmighty.ca/), [Yves Jarvis](https://www.yvesjarvis.com/), and [Apollo Ghosts](https://apolloghosts.bandcamp.com/).

Toronto synthpop duo [Ice Cream](http://ice-creamtheband.tumblr.com/) has a new single out titled "Peanut Butter" with an accompanying video by director Miss World (aka Natalie Chahal). In a statement the band's Carlyn Bezic commented:

> "I wrote 'Peanut Butter' about a man I served when I was bartending, who thought that ordering an expensive scotch meant he could treat me and my coworkers like dirt. That interaction felt like a microcosm of the world at large: that those with the most power and the most money are, underneath it all, spoiled babies. Peanut butter is a stand-in for their values, getting slathered on everything from the messy hands of a child, leaving us to clean it up."

Ice Cream features Bezic and Amanda Crist. The new track was produced by Tony Price, with Steve Chahley mixing and engineering. Ice Cream's debut full-length, *Love, Ice Cream*, came out back in 2016. It was followed by the "Dial Tone" single a year later.

Last week saw a new song surface from [Organ Eyes](http://organeyes.bandcamp.com), the Ottawa-based recording project lead by Cam Steacy. The track, a slow-burning post-punk tune titled "Once Bitten," was written and recorded in the same sessions that resulted in 2018's *Chasing Paper* full-length.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=65699720/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://organeyes.bandcamp.com/track/once-bitten">Once Bitten by Organ Eyes</a></iframe>

Keeping with the ocular theme, Toronto's synth-heavy noise-punk outfit [Eyeballs](https://eyeballsmusic.bandcamp.com) have a new two-song single online, featuring the songs "Weightlifting" and "Woke Up Like This." These tracks mark the band's first recordings since 2016's *Bad Art* full-length, with "Weightlifting" due for an upcoming EP titled *Fun Hell*. Eyeballs feature Jenn Kitagawa on vocals, synth and drums, and Britton Proulx on all of those plus the bass. "Weightlifting" also features the mononymous Koko on vocals (and a Korg Kaossilator synth, to be very specific). The group recorded their new stuff with Asher Gould-Murtagh (ZONES, Beliefs).

Canada Day saw the release of *Upper Canada Blues*, the third full-length in recent months from the prolific [Matthew "Doc" Dunn](https://cosmicrangerecords.bandcamp.com/). The new set follows two solo records the Toronto-based artist released in fast succession in late-2018, *Lightburn* and *See Horses Run*. Like those albums, *Upper Canada Blues* finds Dunn playing jammy psych-rock with early-70s Americana vibes. These recordings feature Dunn backed by [James Matthew VII](https://www.jamesmatthewvii.com/) (of No Warning, fka Blind Matty) and Brian Tysoe. They were recorded last summer by Tony Price.

The album arrives alongside a Laura-Lynn Petrick-directed video for the song "Ribbons," featuring dancer Nyda Kwasowsky. The clip premiered last week at [NOW](https://nowtoronto.com/music/doc-dunn-wlmrt-daniel-caesar/).

Dunn's [U.S. Girls](http://yousgirls.blogspot.ca/)-backing psych-jazz combo [The Cosmic Range](http://thecosmicrange.bandcamp.com) recently released *The Gratitude Principle* on [Idée Fixe Records](http://ideefixerecords.com/).

80s-flavoured Vancouver power-pop trio [Autogramm](http://autogramm.bandcamp.com) has a new single out titled "Bad Day," available from Spain's [Spain's Jarama 45RPM Recs](https://jarama45rpmrecs.bandcamp.com/album/bad-day). It's backed by the b-side "Quiero Estar Sedado," a Spanish language cover of the Ramones classic "I Wanna Be Sedated." These new tracks were recorded and mixed at the Balloon Factory by Joshua Wells and mastered at the North London Bomb Factory by Daniel Husayn.

Autogramm features Jiffy Marx of Hard Drugs and [Blood Meridian](https://bloodmeridiancanada.bandcamp.com/) on vocals, guitar and synth, the globetrotting CC Voltage (of Berlin's Dysnea Boys, London's Loyalties, and BC acts Spitfires and [The Black Halos](https://theblackhalos.bandcamp.com/)) on bass, and The Silo, previously of Black Mountain, Lightning Dust, and Destroyer, on drums. The new music follows the band's 2018 full-length *What R U Waiting 4?*, which arrived last fall on [Nevado Music](http://www.nevadomusic.com).

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=914997937/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://autogramm.bandcamp.com/album/bad-day-quiero-estar-sedado">Bad Day / Quiero Estar Sedado by Autogramm</a></iframe>

Popular Toronto punk quartet [PUP](http://www.puptheband.com/) has a new video online for the *Morbid Stuff* song "Sibling Rivalry." Martin MacPherson directed and animated the piece based on drawings and stories by frontman Stefan Babcock. The visuals chronical Babcock annual camping trips with his sister, along with their escalating and dysfunctional quest to "out-dumb each other."

The 11-song *Morbid Stuff* was recorded at the Union Sound Company last spring with producers Dave Schiffman (Thrice, The Bronx) and Darren McGill. It saw a release earlier this year on Rise Records in the States and the band's [Little Dipper](http://www.littledipperart.com/) imprint in Canada. The album, the group's third, was recently voted onto the Polaris Music Prize long list.

Chance Hutchison of the Montreal garage-punks [PRIORS](https://priorsmtl.bandcamp.com/) and the Devo-core [Sonic Avenues](https://sonicavenues.bandcamp.com/) offshoot [New Vogue](https://newvogue.bandcamp.com) has a new collection of demo recordings online. Released under the name [Cosmic Club](http://cosmicclub.bandcamp.com), the set features 8 slices of tweaked-out robot pop that should certainly satisfy if you're into any of Hutchison's main gigs.

PRIORS recently released their sophomore full-length *New Pleasure* (and an immediate follow-up EP titled *Call For You*) on [Slovenly](http://www.slovenly.com/). The group's been prepping their next LP for a late 2019/early 2020 release. Tour announcements in both Canada and the US are expected soon.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1635728372/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://cosmicclub.bandcamp.com/album/demo">DEMO by Cosmic Club</a></iframe>

Toronto three-piece punk group [Losers](https://biglosers.bandcamp.com/) were the subject of a new short by producer/director Slone McGowan of [LEEK](https://leekprod.ca/losers-welcome-to-help/). The 12-minute clip serves as both a mini-documentary and live music video, chronicling the band's short career to date and the creation of their recent debut cassette *Welcome to Help*. Alongside interviews with the trio, the film features footage of the band playing on the floor of Toronto's [Henderson Brewing Company](https://hendersonbrewing.com/).

The group recorded *Welcome to Help* with producer [Jesse Turnbull](https://www.instagram.com/musicbyturnbull/) at Worst In The City. The EP was released this past April.

Whitby-based grunge-punk act [Chastity](https://chastitysongs.bandcamp.com) recently revealed plans for the follow up to their 2018 debut *Death Lust*. The new record will carry the title *Home Made Satan* and arrives on September 13 from [Dine Alone](http://dinealonerecords.com/) and [Captured Tracks](http://www.capturedtracks.com/). The group released the soaring new single "Sun Poisoning" alongside the announcement, accompanied by a video directed by Justin Singer and frontman Brandon Williams. Filmed in Toronto's High Park, it stars Holden Abraham, son of Fucked Up's Damian Abraham, and Daphne Flowers. Like much of Chastity's output, the song has one foot firmly in the 90s, and you can easily imagine it topping the charts back in the alternative rock era. Williams commented on the song:

> "I wrote a song called 'Sun Poisoning' in 2013, and Kacey Musgraves provoked inspiration in me to bring this back, her lyric 'happy and sad at the same time.' A classic songwriter trope, melancholy, but in my adaptation I wanted to express the feeling of trying to smile when you know your teeth are bleeding. 'Do you want to see how easily my teeth bleed?'"

The press release notes that *Home Made Satan* is meant to serve as the second part of a three-record trilogy. It was recorded in London, Ontario with Williams' full live band in the two-week gap between the group's recent European and North American tours. The album will feature 10 new tracks.

Chastity recently released an EP titled *Death Lust Cuts*, featuring four additional songs trimmed from their debut.

Toronto three-piece garage-rock group [Wine Lips](https://winelips.bandcamp.com) have a new video online for the song "Fly Swatter," from the band's recent sophomore full-length *Stressor*. It follows a similarly energetic clip for their "Shark Eyes" single from earlier this year. Vocalist/guitarist Cam Hilborn commented on the track when speaking to [Exclaim](https://exclaim.ca/music/article/wine_lips_jump_high_in_new_fly_swatter_music_video), and there's no metaphor here:

> "I wrote 'Fly Swatter' after we experienced a really bad fly problem in our apartment. There was literally hundreds of flies all over the house and it was driving us crazy so I spent a night exterminating them one by one until they were gone."

Wine Lips, which features Hilborn with drummer Aurora Evans and bassist Bryan Coffey, are on tour now. Following some immediate upcoming shows in the US midwest they'll take part in the Grey County psych music festival [Crystal Lake](https://www.crystallakesound.ca/) later this month.

Dundas, Ontario power-trio [The Dirty Nil](https://www.facebook.com/thedirtynil/) have continued with their summer covers series, releasing the second pair of *You're Welcome* tracks into the wild. This time out the band included covers of Van Halen's '81 single "Unchained" and April Wine's CanCon radio staple "Oowatanite." The first volume in this series, released in late April, featured the band's take on songs by contemporary San Francisco punk band Culture Abuse and Scottish alternative legends The Jesus and Mary Chain. That April Wine cover originally surfaced as the b-side to their "That's What Heaven Feels Like" 7".

The Dirty Nil's spent much of the last year on the road supporting *Master Volume*, their second LP of new material for [Dine Alone Records](http://dinealonerecords.com/) following 2016's *Higher Power*. The 2018-released album just landed on the Polaris Music Prize long list.
