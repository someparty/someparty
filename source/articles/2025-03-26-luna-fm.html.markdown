###[The Burning Hell](http://www.wearetheburninghell.com/): *Ghost Palace*
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://theburninghell.bandcamp.com/album/ghost-palace)==

[The Burning Hell](http://www.wearetheburninghell.com/) are two or three albums into their dance with the apocalypse. Their early attempts grappled at the unimaginable with a nervous edge, treating societal collapse with gallows humour and powerless anxiety. The specific means to our collective doom was never the focus, though, and Mathias Kom lent his dense wordplay to chronicling ground-level stories of the survivors. Sometimes, that manifested as playful anti-folk songs cataloging the messy cultural detritus left in our wake. As that vision matured, as on 2023's *Garbage Island*, the focus shifted from humanity and addressed the surviving birds (which makes sense; it's not their first time).

On *Ghost Palace*, the disaster, whatever it is (and we're free to take our pick), feels further out of focus, never forgotten but almost mundane in its inevitability. The Burning Hell's outlook remains less dystopian than it is curiously bemused. This is best expressed in the funky psych-rock highlight "Luna FM," told from the perspective of the moon's first and loneliest radio DJ. It's a one-way dialogue between the bored operator and a listenership that's perhaps entirely vanished. The song's one of several stylistic swings on the 11-song record, which hops nimbly between tropical beach jams, quirky synth-rock, and even twangy fiddle-driven country. Kom's lyricism remains an unparalleled firehose of cultural references and wry outsider observations.

*Ghost Palace* came out on March 7 through [You've Changed Records](https://youvechangedrecords.com/) in North America and [BB*Island](https://bbislandmusic.com/) overseas. The Burning Hell's core remains the PEI-based duo of singer/songwriter Mathias Kom and the multi-talented Ariel Sharratt. Their band again features St. John's-based producer/instrumentalist [Jake Nicoll](https://jakenicoll.bandcamp.com/)and fiddler/vocalist Maria Peddle. Guest composer [Carlie Howell](https://carliehowell.ca) (The Electric Storm Collective, Beverly Glenn-Copeland) appears alongside [Constantines](http://theconstantines.wordpress.com/) guitarist [Steven Lambke](http://stevenlambke.com/), [José Contreras](https://www.facebook.com/josecontrerasmusik/) of [By Divine Right](https://bydivineright.bandcamp.com/), and Amy Nicoll.

As a critic (or whatever I am), I realize that the external state of world affairs shouldn't colour my objective view of a piece of art. Still, existential threats abound, and it's hard not to feel that resonate with something slyly hopeful like *Ghost Palace*. The Burning Hell ultimately finds our dishevelled humanity endearing, with Kom never succumbing to angst or bitterness in the face of upheaval and near-certain-ruin. Given the vibe in the country, it's something we could all aspire to.

###[Jake Nicoll](https://jakenicoll.bandcamp.com/): *On Hold*
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://jakenicoll.bandcamp.com/album/on-hold)==

While we're in the orbit of [The Burning Hell](http://www.wearetheburninghell.com/), the band's [Jake Nicoll](https://jakenicoll.bandcamp.com/) recently issued a solo EP to mark a significant milestone. Released in early February, the five-song *On Hold* captures the nervous anticipation of impending parenthood. Nicoll wrote and recorded the set while his partner Pamela Mackenzie waited for the birth of their first child last year.

The EP's opener, "Waiting Room," directly references the Fugazi anthem of the same name, pairing vintage synths and gated drums with samples from the hospital's phone tree. "Galloping Horses" builds a synth-pop earworm around the pulse of a fetal heart monitor, giving the young Mackenzie Nicoll their first album credit. The high BPM of the Doppler drives the track towards a "synthy love-child of Kraftwerk and Men Without Hats." You can find the set at Bandcamp.

The 25-minute collection follows Nicoll's 2024 LP *Lonely Mission*, an accomplished set that focused the producer's skills on "the larger questions of life and the future of this warming planet." That record emerged from pandemic-era isolation on his family farm in St. John's, where Nicoll built a cabin studio with a workshop of vintage equipment. In 2023, Jake and Pamela issued the split indie-folk album *End Daze* as the duo [Pami and Jake](https://pamiandjake.bandcamp.com).

###[Michael Cloud Duguay](https://michaelcloudduguay.bandcamp.com): *Wobbly Yonder*
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://michaelcloudduguay.bandcamp.com/album/wobbly-yonder)==

Peterborough luminary [Michael Cloud Duguay](https://michaelcloudduguay.bandcamp.com) recently announced *Wobbly Yonder*, a new solo LP arriving April 25 through [Watch That Ends The Night](https://watchthatendsthenight.bandcamp.com). The album finds the introspective singer-songwriter amassing a staggering roster of 19 collaborators crisscrossing the Canadian indie music spectrum. That list notably includes Mathias Kom, Ariel Sharratt, and Jake Nicoll of [The Burning Hell](http://www.wearetheburninghell.com/) (if the through-line in this edition of the newsletter isn't apparent, there was a serendipitous tangle of connective tissue sitting in my inbox). You can preview the album through the lushly orchestrated dream-pop of the lead single, "Immutable White Light." On the track, the artist revealed:

>"'Immutable White Light' is about the seemingly fixed nature of our internal lives, and the inability to witness spiritual progress in oneself except for in hindsight. It is about how, in my darkest moments, my true inner self was never lost but was obfuscated by external concerns. It's about how grace and light can be found through connection with a higher power and one's authentic self."

"The Only Angel In Sight," co-written by Toronto's Sara Jarvie-Clark ([Analogues of May](https://analoguesofmay.com)), is also available to stream. A press release describes a slow-burning folk epic that "explores themes of social paranoia and inhibition" and "the psychedelic experience and fuzzy contracts of fledgling romance."

While increasingly prolific, Duguay doesn't issue new material lightly. It often feels that each step in the artist's career is hard-won and the subject of much consternation. *Wobbly Yonder* has similar roots, stemming from a traumatic 2009 experience when he performed as part of The Burning Hell at Slovakia's Pohoda Festival. A catastrophic storm hit the event, claiming two lives and injuring dozens. "The experience cracked something open in me," recalls Duguay, who stepped away from music for an extended period following the incident. The artist's output in the years since has explicitly grappled with mental illness.

The new album finds Duguay reconnecting with The Burning Hell roster. Kom and Sharratt share performance and production credits on the new record. Furthermore, at their urging the Duguay recorded with [Jake Nicoll](https://jakenicoll.bandcamp.com/) in The Scamper, a solar-powered studio built in a 70s-era camper. This mobile setup allowed the artist to record exclusively in unconventional spaces, from beaches to an abandoned farmhouse to the lantern room of PEI's East Point Lighthouse.

The eight-song *Wobbly Yonder* features appearances from [Eliza Niemi](https://elizaniemi.bandcamp.com/), Andrew MacKelvie ([New Hermitage](https://newhermitage.bandcamp.com), Scions), Jamie Kronick (Scattered Clouds), [Carlie Howell](https://carliehowell.ca) (The Electric Storm Collective, Beverly Glenn-Copeland), [José Contreras](https://www.facebook.com/josecontrerasmusik/) ([By Divine Right](https://bydivineright.bandcamp.com/)), and [Owen Davies](https://owendaviesmusic.bandcamp.com), among others. Stylistically, the record leaps from ambient interludes to anthemic rock and hushed folk ballads.

This release follows a productive 2024 for Duguay, which saw him issue the "experimental heartland totalism" full-length *Succeeder* and *To Cry Out In The Wilderness*, the debut from the experimental ensemble [Scions](https://scions.bandcamp.com/).

###[Eliza Niemi](https://elizaniemi.bandcamp.com/): *Progress Bakery*
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://elizaniemi.bandcamp.com/album/progress-bakery)==

[Eliza Niemi](https://elizaniemi.bandcamp.com/)'s new LP floors me. It so singularly captivates that I've spent the past week listening to either *Progress Bakery* or nothing. We need to cling to whatever small reprieves we uncover. You all know why. It's a survival mechanism in 2025. That Niemi can hook you while favouring quiet moments and sparse arrangements makes her new album a welcome salve. Whether she intended it that way doesn't much matter. It could be a happy accident, but it's perfect for the current moment.

*Progress Bakery* arrived last week through [Vain Mina](https://vainmina.bandcamp.com/) and the UK-based [Tin Angel Records](https://tinangelrecords.bandcamp.com/), delivering 15 songs that percolate with wry observations and a deft sense of minimalism that's always friendly, never austere. The record features contributions from a notable cast of Toronto indie musicians, including Jeremy Ray, Evan Cartwright (Tasseomancy, US Girls), [Louie Short](https://louieshort.bandcamp.com/), [Little Kid](https://littlekid.bandcamp.com/)'s Kenny Boothby, Ed Squires of the [Badge Époque Ensemble](https://badgeepoque.bandcamp.com), Steven McPhail from [Mr. Joy](https://mrjoy.bandcamp.com/), and [Dorothea Paas](https://dorotheapaas.bandcamp.com/) among others. Short and Ray co-produced the album alongside Niemi.

*Progress Bakery* follows Niemi's 2022 solo debut, *Staying Mellow Blows*. You've undoubtedly heard her on various Canadian records over the past few years, often guesting on cello. Before that, she co-led the Montreal act [Mauno](https://mauno.bandcamp.com/). *Progress Bakery* surpasses it all, and it's one of the early standouts of 2025.

###[Cassia Hardy](https://cassiahardy.bandcamp.com/): "Empress"
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://cassiahardy.bandcamp.com/track/empress)==

[Wares](https://wares.bandcamp.com) principle [Cassia Hardy](https://cassiahardy.bandcamp.com/) recently shared a long-in-the-works ode to the defunct Edmonton venue The Empress Ale House. "Empress" builds upon specific recollections to reflect on our community's broader loss of shared cultural spaces. The artist describes the rollicking noise-pop track as "a composite photo of a few places close to my heart as a patron and a worker." She elaborates:

>"Head and shoulders above them was The Empress. I can still see the way it looked at last call, when the house lights went up. Animal skulls lined the blood red walls, the dark wooden tables at once sticky and slippery. We served beer by the imperial pint, free pretzels, and a petrified $30 hungry man dinner in the freezer to satisfy the license.
>
>As unique as it was, like so many other places, the landlords got greedy and didn't know what they were messing with. Some folks who went might never know what happened, some might not care to, and more and more will never have seen it at all. Sometimes the sweet things in life don't burn out or fade away, they are taken."

Matt McKeen recorded the track, which Hardy dedicates to Empress owner Sue Kiernan. It's the first we've heard from her since Wares' 2023 singles "Graceless/Cloudless," which followed up their 2020 album *Survival*. The new tune arrives via [Mint Records](https://www.mintrecs.com/).
