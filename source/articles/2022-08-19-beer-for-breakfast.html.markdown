###[Punk Canada Vol 1](https://ripcordz.bandcamp.com/album/punk-canada-vol-1)
==Preview and purchase on [Bandcamp](https://ripcordz.bandcamp.com/album/punk-canada-vol-1)==

This summer saw the arrival of *Punk Canada Vol 1*, an ambitious new covers compilation spearheaded by Paul Gott of Montreal lifers the [Ripcordz](https://ripcordz.bandcamp.com/). Arriving through the artist's storied En Guard Records label, the 16-song set presents a cross-country cast of currently active punk groups delivering fresh renditions of their forbearers. The participants sourced a mix of some of the country's pioneering punk acts (The Modernettes and The Demics are perhaps the most prominent names here) with a scattershot collection of smaller groups better known in their local scenes. The obscurity ultimately works in the record's favour, and it's impressive how many obvious candidates were left in the toybox.

Given the punk roots of this newsletter and my baffling conceit that geography matters as listening criteria, I couldn't leave this stone unturned. In that spirit, here's a track-by-track breakdown:

- Regina's [Bats Out!](https://batsout.bandcamp.com/) take on "Better Not Say No" by Quebec Oi! group Shock Troops.
- Vancouver's [The Shit Talkers](https://theshittalkers.bandcamp.com/) (rather thrillingly) rework "Talk's Cheap" by London legends The Demics.
- Victoria's [The Gnar Gnars](https://thegnargnars.bandcamp.com/) play "Natural Born Swillers" by the 90s-era [Dayglo Abortions](https://murraythecretinacton.bandcamp.com/)/[Bunchofuckingoofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunchofuckingoofs) offshoot Lummox (with guest vocals, appropriately enough, by Murray 'The Cretin' Action himself).
- [Ripcordz](https://ripcordz.bandcamp.com/), of course, take part and revive "Stay 19" by the 80s Hamilton act The Wet Spots.
- Montreal gutter punks [Whiskey Shits](https://whiskeyshits.bandcamp.com/) take on "Mainstream Crap" by the 90s Vancouver Oi! group [Subway Thugs](https://subwaythugs.bandcamp.com/).
- Kingston's [The Beta 58's](https://thebeta58s.bandcamp.com) play "Leave Me Alone" by Vancouver garage sleazoids The Fiends.
- Quebec City's [Dysruptive](https://dysruptive.bandcamp.com) go with "Thinking Naturally" by Manitoban pioneers [Lowlife](https://lowlife79.bandcamp.com).
- Winnipeg act [Chernobyl Wolves](https://chernobylwolves.bandcamp.com/) traverse their own family tree, covering "Reservations" by their Edmonton ancestors Euthanasia.
- Modern-day Edmontonians [Reifer Madness](https://reifer.bandcamp.com/) meanwhile go with "Progress" by their hometown's Cadillac Of Worms.
- Halifax horror-punks [The Bloody Hell](https://thebloodyhell.bandcamp.com) take on "Barbra," an absolute classic from Vancouver power-pop heroes The Modernettes.
- Calgary's brashly named [Motherfuckers](https://motherfuckers.bandcamp.com/) pick "Exit Death" by the 80s Montreal punks S.C.U.M.
- Toronto's [Random Killing](https://randomkilling.bandcamp.com/) keep it local with "Rat Poison High" by their contemporaries [Armed & Hammered](https://armedandhammered.bandcamp.com).
- Hamilton's [Artificial Dissemination](https://artificialdissemination.bandcamp.com/) cover "Hate Generation" by the 80s Toronto hardcore legends Direct Action.
- Snotty Moncton group [The Follow Ups](http://thefollowups.bandcamp.com) play "About to Drown" by Ottawa's Furnaceface.
- [The Nasties](https://thenastiesguelph.bandcamp.com/) from Guelph dip all the way back to 1978 to resurrect "Sick Boy" by Toronto's The Anemics.
- Fredericton's [Hard Charger](https://hardcharger.bandcamp.com/) wrap things up with "Beer for Breakfast" by Dunnville, Ontario's Problem Children.

I was about to write something hyperbolic to celebrate the first mention of the mighty Dunnville in this newsletter, but I let the occasion pass unremarked upon back in 2018. Oh well. Look for *Punk Canada Vol 1* on vinyl soon. Online availability seems a little iffy at the moment, so one of the bands' supporting tour dates may be your best bet. Digitally you can pluck these tracks from Bandcamp now.

###[Julie Aubé](https://www.julieaube.me/): "Changer le mal de place"
==Watch on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/w6BgNjs1n2g) - Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://julieaube.bandcamp.com/track/changer-le-mal-de-place)==

[Julie Aubé](https://www.julieaube.me/) recently shared the second single from her forthcoming LP *Contentement*, with "
Changer le mal de place" boasting a propulsive country twang. Aubé, known as one-third of the Acadian indie-folk act [Les Hay Babies](http://leshaybabies.bandcamp.com), spoke to [Le Canal Auditif](https://lecanalauditif.ca/chansons/julie-aube-changer-le-mal-de-place/) about the track, revealing (en francais) the song's roots in memories of her father. That nostalgia's on full display in the accompanying video, directed by the artist and comprised of VHS footage from old family movies. The track follows the album's triumphant first single, "Le temps des mûres."

Aubé co-wrote and recorded with Memramcook producer-songwriter [Mike Trask](https://miketrask.ca). The record features Mico Roy ([Les Hôtesses d'Hilaire](https://leshotessesdhilaire.bandcamp.com/)) on guitar, [Papal Visit](http://papalvisit.bandcamp.com)'s [Adam Mowery](https://itsadammowery.bandcamp.com) on bass, Matthew Gallant on drums, and backing vocals from [Salesbarbes](https://salebarbes.bandcamp.com/)' Kevin McIntyre and Les Hay Babies' Katrine Noël.

As a member of Les Hay Babies, Julie Aubé last issued *Boîte aux lettres* in February of 2020. *Contentement* arrives on September 9 from [Simone Records](https://www.simonerecords.net/), landing nearly five years after her solo debut, *Joie de Vivre*.

###[C.ROSS](https://nxnx.bandcamp.com/): *Skull Creator*
==Watch on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/uQXUONB75FQ) - Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://nxnx.bandcamp.com/album/skull-creator)==

Chad Ross has had quite a trip since his days with Toronto garage legends [The Deadly Snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deadly_Snakes) - performing increasingly far-out psych with [Quest for Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_for_Fire_(band)) and later [Comet Control](https://cometcontrol.bandcamp.com/). While he's performed solo in the past as Nordic Nomadic, last month, the artist re-emerged as [C.ROSS](https://nxnx.bandcamp.com/), issuing the LP *Skull Creator* through Atlanta's [Echodelick Records](https://echodelickrecords.com/), Australia's [Ramble Records](https://ramblerecords.com/), and [NoiseAgonyMahem](http://www.noiseagonymayhem.com/) domestically. The record delivers eight tracks of slow-burning psych-folk, presenting a fully realized, mature sound nearly a decade from Nordic Nomadic's last album, *Worldwide Skyline*.

Joshua Wells (Lightning Dust, Destroyer, Black Mountain) produced and mixed the album from the Balloon Factory in Vancouver. He also performs drums and keys on the record. Guests include Isaiah Mitchell (Earthless, Golden Void, the Black Crowes) on guitar and Aaron Goldstein (Daniel Romano, Bry Webb) on pedal steel. Ross commented on the ensemble, stating:

>"I had it in my head that I was gonna make an acoustic record, with the sole purpose of making fun of myself, reflecting on a few of my past wasted lives and just generally taking the singer/songwriter thing out with the trash. The lyrics all made me laugh at one point, but when Josh and Isaiah got involved, things got elevated... as they tend to do with musicians like that."

You can see a trippy video for the single "Wrong Side of the Sky" on YouTube, directed by the Waterloo artist/musician Olde Nightrifter.

###[Shearing Pinx](https://shearingpinx.bandcamp.com/): Splits with The Drivers and Ex-Softess
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://isolatednowwaves.bandcamp.com/album/ex-softess-shearing-pinx)==

While it's been several years since the last proper LP from Vancouver noise-punk heroes [Shearing Pinx](https://shearingpinx.bandcamp.com/), they offer no shortage of new material through a seemingly unending stream of splits and collaborations. The [Isolated Now Waves](https://isolatednowwaves.bandcamp.com/) label has two new collections available digitally and on cassette this summer.

First, the group has a split out with The Drivers, the solo project of Chris Ando of the Seattle groups Talbot Tagora and Mikaela's Fiend. The Shearing Pinx side features a studio improv piece with a skronky appearance from [Dry Goods](https://drygoods1.bandcamp.com/)' Liam Murphy on sax. The Drivers, meanwhile, offer "one 15min mind fvck jammer."

The second split finds Shearing Pinx paired with the Vancouver no-wave/noise trio [Ex-Softess](https://ex-softess.bandcamp.com/), who deliver a pair of instrumentals. The Pinx side of the tape's also instrumental, presenting material recorded with Jesse Taylor of the electronic/darkwave group [In Mirrors](https://inmirrors2.bandcamp.com).

Both sets are available in cassette runs of 50, with whatever's remaining up for sale on Bandcamp. Shearing Pinx last issued the LP *People* in 2014 through [Psychic Handshake](http://www.psychichandshake.com/). That same year they appeared on at least a half-dozen splits with then-active bands like Hag Face and Soupcans. Last year the group put out *When You Have No Taste, You Can Do Anything*, an anthology of previously unreleased material spanning 2008 through 2019.

###[UWUW](https://uwuw.bandcamp.com): "Scattered Ashes"
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://uwuw.bandcamp.com/album/s-t)==

This fall will see the debut full-length from the newly formed Toronto supergroup [UWUW](https://uwuw.bandcamp.com). The band brings together bassist/keyboardist Jason Haberman (Dan Mangan, Yeahsun, The Wooden Sky), percussionist Jay Anderson ([Badge Époque Ensemble](https://badgeepoque.bandcamp.com), [Lammping](https://lammping.bandcamp.com/), Biblical) and guitarist/keyboardist/producer [Ian Blurton](https://ianblurton.bandcamp.com/) (Ian Blurton's Future Now, Change of Heart, C'mon). They're joined on the album's four extended tracks by two distinct songwriters - Chris A. Cummings (aka [Marker Starling](https://markerstarling.bandcamp.com/)) and Drew Smith ([Bunny](https://bunnytoronto.bandcamp.com/), [The Bicycles](https://thebicycles.bandcamp.com/)), each fronting a pair of songs.

You can now hear the classically cool first single, "Scattered Ashes," streaming at Bandcamp. It's one of Starling's tunes on the record. The vocalist commented on his approach to the smooth psych-funk track:

>"I attempted to shoehorn every stray apocalyptic thought I had circa Summer of 2021 into the song, including readings from the screenplay of Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville (1965). The world is ending, or perhaps, as Sun Ra believed, we're already past the end of the world. You might end up dying for a cause, or even 'just because.' Who knows what tomorrow may bring, and like The Zombies, being forever Hung Up on a Dream—in this case, a lost vision of a kind of hippie or punk utopia—is the only way to live your life, the only way to maintain a healing state of mind"

In addition to the leading players, each song features infectious horn arrangements by Jay Hey. He appears here on saxophone alongside Tom Richardson on trombone and Patrick McGroarty on trumpet. The band's self-titled LP arrives October 21 through [We Are Busy Bodies](https://wearebusybodies.bandcamp.com).

###[Klarka Weinwurm](https://klarkaweinwurm.bandcamp.com/): "Ten Years"
==Watch on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/D_Egejw6-pw) - Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://klarkaweinwurm.bandcamp.com/album/easy-days)==

Since the lead-up to Sappyfest I've had the new [Klarka Weinwurm](https://klarkaweinwurm.bandcamp.com/) album in near constant rotation. The 10-song *Easy Days* marries a restrained bed of lo-fi indie fuzz with Weinwurm's distinctively vulnerable vocals - thoroughly rooted in the tradition of New Brunswick legends like Eric's Trip and Julie Doiron. The band recently served album-opener "Ten Years" as the record's latest single, paired with a vintage-styled video. Filmmaker Winston DeGiobbi shot the foot in Cape Breton last October.

*Easy Days* arrived in early July, nearly seven years out from the Sackville band's *Huddle* EP. The group recorded with Dave Trenaman at The Quarantine in Port Greville, Nova Scotia, between the summer of 2019 and December of 2020. In the studio, Klarka Weinwurm performed with bassist Ian MacDougall ([The Tom Fun Orchestra](https://thetomfunorchestra.bandcamp.com)) and drummer Luke Patterson ([The Mouthbreathers](https://themouthbreathers.bandcamp.com/)). On tour this summer, Weinwurm's backed by bassist Evan Matthews (The Mouthbreathers, [Yellowteeth](https://yellow-teeth.bandcamp.com/)) and returning drummer Glenn Barrington ([Snake Noise](https://snakenoise1.bandcamp.com)).

###[PONY](https://ponytheband.ca): "Peach"
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://ponytheband.ca/track/peach)==

Fresh from the road supporting Fucked Up, Sam Bielanski's bubblegum-punk outfit [PONY](https://ponytheband.ca) shared a new single this week titled "Peach." Bielanski revealed:

>"I think 'Peach' is probably the most vulnerable song I have ever written. After all, what's more vulnerable than a Peach?
>
>Some years ago I found myself in a relationship with someone who initially treated me like I was so special. But little by little the love seemed more and more conditional. With every bit they tried to control what I wore, who I talked to, and what I did - I lost a part of myself. It took me years to realize I was completely gone and I mistook abuse and manipulation for love. Peach is about realizing that someone who wants to have control over you is not someone who loves you."

The track follows June's stand-along single "Did It Again" and arrives in the wake of their 2021 full-length *TV Baby*. That LP landed last spring through Massachusetts' [Take This To Heart Records](http://www.takethistoheartrecords.com/). The track also surfaces just a few weeks after "See You Again," the new single from the Toronto power-pop group [Pretty Matty](https://prettymatty.com), which featured Bielanski on bass and backing vocals.

###[DogsnotGods](https://dogsnotgods.bandcamp.com/): *EPII*
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://dogsnotgods.bandcamp.com/album/epii)==

Five-piece Moncton punk group [DogsnotGods](https://dogsnotgods.bandcamp.com/) recently returned with *EPII*, a six-song set of too-tough-to-die Ramones worship with vocals deeply nestled in the lo-fi murk. While we've heard this style played countless times, it never feels tired when done well. DogsnotGods seem to understand whatever magic formula makes it work.

The band features [Fear of Lipstick](https://fearoflipstick.bandcamp.com/)'s Jerms O'Neill on vocals, backed by guitarists Justin and Dean, bassist Trev, and drummer Mike. The new set follows the band's first EP from January 2021, and the "Call Me a Failure" single of the same era.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3405233840/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://dogsnotgods.bandcamp.com/album/epii">EPII by DogsnotGods</a></iframe>

###[The Ember Glows](https://theemberglows.bandcamp.com): "Silent Love"
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://theemberglows.bandcamp.com/track/silent-love)==

Montreal post-punk quartet [The Ember Glows](https://theemberglows.bandcamp.com) recently issued "Silent Love," a new single that somehow authentically captures the sound and spirit of 80s heroes like Echo and the Bunnymen, Simple Minds, and The Cult. The group recorded at Closet Studios with John Gurnsey and producer Daniel Karrasch. Vocalist/guitarist Martin Saint commented on the track in a press release, stating:

>"This song came about when my ex-girlfriend lost her father last year. This is about how powerless one feels when a loved one mourns the loss of a close relative. The old clichés and platitudes won't help but you still want to offer the gift of silence and love. Because it came from the heart, the song wrote itself. Even the first band run-through sounded good already. We all knew then it'd be a special one."

The Ember Glows emerged in 2019, accruing members from the Montreal bands Room Control, REPO, Scene Noir, and Citylake. The group features Richard Bunze on lead guitar, bassist Kevin Hills, Martin Saint on vocals, keys, and guitar, and Dan Stefik drumming. The new single follows the band's debut 2021 EP *Passerby*.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1533028780/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://theemberglows.bandcamp.com/track/silent-love">SILENT LOVE by The Ember Glows</a></iframe>

###[Sea Of Troubles](https://seaoftroublesband.bandcamp.com/): *Victor*
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://seaoftroublesband.bandcamp.com/album/victor)==

Hamilton noise-punk trio [Sea Of Troubles](https://seaoftroublesband.bandcamp.com/) recently issued "Victor," a brisk and aggressive new single. It's so lo-fi and distorted that you can't make a word out - but satisfyingly so. It comes packaged with two noise collages, each thoroughly unpredictable but never meandering. The complete set's altogether less than four minutes long.

The tracks follow Sea of Troubles' 2021 single "Busted" and their avant-guard full-length *カンニング*. The group performs as a trio featuring vocalist/guitarist Denzel Gordon, drummer Jeremy Hopkins, and bassist Matt Rockingham.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3885130824/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://seaoftroublesband.bandcamp.com/album/victor">Victor by Sea of Troubles</a></iframe>

###[Heavy Bedroom](https://heavybedroom.bandcamp.com): "Distorted Organs"
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://heavybedroom.bandcamp.com/album/distorted-organs-furl)==

The moody Ottawa indie rockers [Heavy Bedroom](https://heavybedroom.bandcamp.com) returned earlier this month after an extended absence, delivering a two-song digital single at Bandcamp. You can preview the a-side "Distorted Organs," a quiet-yet-weighty song that scratches that Three Gut Records itch. The track features Alex Maltby on vocals and guitar, Cory Lefebvre on guitar and synths, Matthew Gilmour on bass, and Tyler Goodman drumming.

The new songs follow a 2016 split with fellow Capital locals [King's Quest](https://kingsquest.bandcamp.com/) and the group's 2014 debut EP *I Saw An End*.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=621110505/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://heavybedroom.bandcamp.com/album/distorted-organs-furl">Distorted Organs/Furl by heavy bedroom</a></iframe>

###[Spite House](https://spitehousemtl.bandcamp.com): "Dying Leaves"
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://spitehousemtl.bandcamp.com/track/dying-leaves-2)==

Montreal post-hardcore group [Spite House](https://spitehousemtl.bandcamp.com) kicked off August with "Dying Leaves," the second single from their forthcoming debut. That self-titled album arrives on August 26 through the [New Morality Zine](https://newmoralityzine.com/), featuring ten songs. Speaking to Brooklyn Vegan, vocalist/guitarist Maxime Lajoie revealed the personal tragedy fueling the track:

>"It is a song about the morning I last saw my father. I walked to school on November 2nd. A few moments later, he left our house for the last time. He was wearing the same old clothes for a week (red clothes). I was 16 at the time and knew something was very weird and wrong, but couldn't or didn't know what to do about it. I'm not sure I'd go into more details of what happened, but we are releasing the song on what would've been his 70th birthday."

Spite House features Maxime Lajoie on guitar and vocals, Marc Tremblay on percussion, and bassist Nabil Ortega. The upcoming record marks the latest in a series of recent projects from Lajoie - including the *Love Business* EP from the 90s alternative-styled [Seed Toss](https://seedtossmtl.bandcamp.com).

###[Kingfisher](https://officialkingfisher.bandcamp.com/): *Hidden Enemy*
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://officialkingfisher.bandcamp.com/album/hidden-enemy)==

Ottawa punk group [Kingfisher](https://officialkingfisher.bandcamp.com/) recently issued their third EP of the year, a four-song set of politically charged, 90s-styled melodic hardcore dubbed *Hidden Enemy*.

The set follows the quartet's April release *Generation Zero* and a self-titled set from January. The group, heavily inspired by EpiFat-era bands like Face to Face and No Use For a Name, came together last November from former members of The Fully Down and [In Heat](https://inheatofficial.bandcamp.com/) (among others). The group features vocalist/guitarist Brent Walker, vocalist/guitarist Joe Brownrigg, bassist Casey Conner, and drummer Dave Dorval.

###[Solitüde](https://solitde.bandcamp.com/): Split with Mode Alarme
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://solitde.bandcamp.com/album/split-with-mode-alarme)==

Montreal goth duo [Solitüde](https://solitde.bandcamp.com/) has a new split album assembled with the Gatineau post-punk act [Mode Alarme](https://modealarme.bandcamp.com/) (members of [Inespy](https://runstatetapes.bandcamp.com/album/inepsy-the-lost-tracks) and [Droidz](https://droidz1.bandcamp.com/)). Solitüde's side of the record features three songs - two new originals and a remaster of "Cold Mist" from their [Pils Sessions](https://pilssessions.bandcamp.com) set.

The group recorded at Pils' NOMANSLAND studio with producer Chany Pilote last December. Solitüde features Janick and Pask of the UK82 bruisers [Fractured](https://fractured3.bandcamp.com) - with the former handling vocals and lyrics and the latter crafting the group's moody instrumentals.

###[Fortunato Durutti Marinetti](https://fortunatoduruttimarinetti.bandcamp.com): "Just Like a Singer"
==Watch on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/MvZZVRbdFyg) - Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://fortunatoduruttimarinetti.bandcamp.com/album/desire-2)==

After a winding journey through several formats, Toronto singer-songwriter [Fortunato Durutti Marinetti](https://fortunatoduruttimarinetti.bandcamp.com) is finally bringing their evocative 2020 debut *Desire* to vinyl. The artist recorded in the winter and spring of 2018 and 2018, later enlisting Vancouver indie-pop mainstay [Jay Arner](https://jayarner.bandcamp.com/) to mix and master. The resulting work only saw a limited cassette release in the general chaos of 2020. Look for the vinyl, completed as intended, on September 8 through [Second Spring](https://secondspring.online/), with remastered audio, extended artwork, and an included excerpt from author Asesina Hudson's novella *Blob*.

The news arrived with a video for the song "Just Like a Singer," directed by Ron Tran. The clip features footage recorded in Toronto, Vancouver, and Vernon, BC over the past year. You can see it now on YouTube.

Born in Turin and based in Toronto, Daniel Colussi launched the FDM stage name after performing for over twenty years with bands like [The Shilohs](https://theshilohs.bandcamp.com/) and [The Pinc Lincolns](https://thepinclincolns.bandcamp.com/), among others. This project finds him exploring jazz-influenced folk-rock informed by legends like Lou Reed, Leonard Cohen, and Joni Mitchell.

While *Desire* only lands on vinyl this fall, it's already seen a follow-up. Fortunato Durutti Marinetti issued their sophomore LP, *Memory's Fool* in March through [Bobo Integral](https://bobointegral.com/) and [Soft Abuse](https://softabuse.bandcamp.com).

###[36?](https://whatis36.bandcamp.com/): "Natural"
==Watch on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/QZhdf5gOXUw)==

Calgarian art-rock unit [36?](https://whatis36.bandcamp.com/) recently shared "Natural," the band's second single of the summer and another dizzying display of their restlessly eclectic songwriting. The track finds the group working at a relatively relaxed pace compared to July's "Samuel" - not that the acid-trip nightmare of an accompanying music video helps offers much in the way of calm. In a feature at the [Cups N Cakes Network](https://www.cupsncakespod.com/news/2022/8/14/premiere-36-natural), project principle Taylor Cochrane revealed:

>"I think most artists have an internal struggle when they are creating art and for me a lot of that comes from thinking too much about how the art is going to be received when I really want to just be basking in the moment and letting things flow naturally."

You can see "Natural" on YouTube along with last month's "[Samuel](https://youtu.be/b85Ofj7oqe0)" clip. Both songs stem from *Naturally*, a new full-length due through Montana's [North Pole Records](https://northpolerecords.com/). Look for that material, the result of pandemic-era home recordings by the group's then-isolated players, to be released throughout the year. The new material (including May's one-off single "Write") follows up on the group's 2019 LP, *Milk Mountain*.

###[Affiliate Links](https://affiliatelinks.bandcamp.com/): "Baby's Changing Stations"
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://affiliatelinks.bandcamp.com/album/enough-light)==

Bradley Davis is a Hamilton-based singer-songwriter recording rather elegant (if downbeat) indie rock under the name [Affiliate Links](https://affiliatelinks.bandcamp.com/). [We Are Busy Bodies](https://wearebusybodies.bandcamp.com) has the artist's debut solo LP *Enough Light* lined up for a September 9 release. It's an 11-song set you can preview now through the hooky psych-pop of "Baby's Changing Stations" and the fuzzy, propulsive "Walk on Water."

For over a decade, Davis recorded and performed as a member of the instrumental Toronto post-rock unit [Fresh Snow](https://freshsnow.bandcamp.com/). Much of *Enough Light* came together at home, tracked solo during the worst of the pandemic when collaboration was off the table (he admits "I have never been good at relaxing" in a press release). [Holy Fuck](https://www.holyfuckmusic.com/)'s Graham Walsh picked up the recordings last summer to mix.

###[Carbon Memory](https://carbonmemory.bandcamp.com/): "The Only One"
==Watch on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/9ID_vNb87nY) - Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://carbonmemory.bandcamp.com/album/tourist)==

Last week the Toronto alt-rock quartet [Carbon Memory](https://carbonmemory.bandcamp.com/) issued their sophomore EP, a slick five-song set dubbed *Tourist*. The release landed alongside a hand-drawn, digitally animated video for the single "The Only One." Over the past year, the band created the visuals in-house, with lead guitarist Demian Abal giving life to images by vocalist Dennis Neves. The group commented on creating the sci-fi-themed piece:

>"Everything was hand drawn, digitally coloured and animated painstakingly using Adobe After Effects. It nearly broke us. The video is as much of a representation of the song as is the final studio recording... We wanted to keep the ending open to interpretation. Is the whole experience a dream, achieved self-realization or the result of creative sabotage? ['The Only One' is] about negotiating and protecting creative energy in our lives, seeing creativity as something that needs to be nourished. The further you grow apart from it, the further you feel from yourself."

The group worked in the studio with Holy Fuck's Graham Walsh producing at Candle Recording. Carbon Memory features vocalist/guitarist Dennis Neves, guitarist Demian Abal, bassist Andy Ranieri, and drummer Demian Abal.

###[Ducks Ltd.](https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com): "In Between Days" (ft. Jane Inc)
==Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com/track/in-between-days-feat-jane-inc) - Watch on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/oue8u6n-Qns)==

[Ducks Ltd.](https://ducksltdband.bandcamp.com)'s covers series *The Sincerest Form of Flattery* continues to roll out, presenting new renditions of classic songs by the Toronto jangle-pop group and a rotating cast of guests. The latest finds the band performing a bright and faithful version of The Cure's "In Between Days." The group tackles the '85 single with the help of [Jane Inc](https://janeinc.bandcamp.com/) (aka [Ice Cream](https://icecreeeammm.bandcamp.com/)'s Carlyn Bezic).

Singer/guitarist Tom McGreevy revealed:

>"Robert Smith is a genius and the Cure are the best and I absolutely love this song. It's such a simple one but all of the pieces slot together so neatly. We listened to all the demos he made of it, and it's cool to hear how clearly the fundamental parts of it are realized on the very first one, even though he doesn't have any lyrics yet and is just wordlessly singing the melody (which I also do when we demo stuff!). We mostly tracked this one on a day off when we were on tour with Nation of Language, so the vocal was tracked in the front seat of a parked Mitsubishi Outlander in the middle of the night outside an Airbnb in Grand Junction, Colorado. It's also the first thing we've made that our bass player Katie plays on."

The covers series debuted in March with a version of Jesus & Mary Chain's "Head On." The new recordings follow Ducks Ltd.'s recent one-off  "Shades of Grey" and their [Royal Mountain](https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/)/ [Carpark](http://carparkrecords.com/) LP, *Modern Fiction*. On that album, the band recorded as a duo comprised of Tom McGreevy (vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) and Evan Lewis (guitar, bass, drum programming).

###[Sloan](http://sloanmusic.com/): "Scratch the Surface"
==Watch on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4UFGlqBejPw) - Preview and purchase at [Bandcamp](https://sloanmusic.bandcamp.com/track/scratch-the-surface)==

The city of Toronto plays a starring role in [Sloan](https://sloanmusic.bandcamp.com/)'s new video for "Scratch the Surface," the second single from their upcoming full-length *Steady*. Chris Murphy commented on the filming process in a press release, stating:

>"We haven't done a video per se since 'Unkind' from *The Double Cross*, which was over 10 years ago, and we thought it was time we came up with some new visuals because, let's face it, we look pretty good.
>
>Sloan crew and friend that requires I pay him, Haris Cehajic, was bringing his drone to Sloan shows and taking this great footage and I insisted we could make a cool video for "Scratch the Surface" using the drone. The song talks about being alone in the city and I thought we could get some drone shots of buildings downtown and make up the rest on the spot à la the videos from our first record, *Smeared*. I am happy to have this visual representation of Sloan in 2022. If this video doesn't go viral, it's the last video I'm ever making. Maybe it will go fungal. That's my dad's joke. Self-producing the video presented a few challenges — the band even lost one of their soaring cameras along the way! — Hey, if you find a drone near the Eaton Centre, contact me."

The track's one of twelve slated for *Steady*, the indie legends' 13th studio album. It's due through [Yep Roc Records](https://www.yeproc.com/) on October 21, arriving 30 years to the month from *Smeared*. Sloan impressively still boasts their classic lineup of guitarist/vocalist Patrick Pentland, bassist/vocalist Chris Murphy, drummer/vocalist Andrew Scott, and guitarist/vocalist Jay Ferguson. The new record follows up their 2018 LP *12* and the two recent *B Sides Win* collections issued through the group's Murderecords.
