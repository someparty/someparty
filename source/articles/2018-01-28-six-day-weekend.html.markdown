Last week the annual Montreal punk festival [Pouzza](https://pouzzafest.com/) confirmed about half of their 2018 lineup. The top of the bill has a decidedly 90s feel with, 3rd wave ska groups like Reel Big Fish and MU330 listed alongside protest punks Anti-Flag and the melodic hardcore act A Wilhelm Scream. The roster, which you can explore in full at the event's website, includes bands like War on Women, Tsunami Bomb, Dan Potthast, Timeshares.

The Pouzza lineup has always included a significant Canadian contingent, including a sizable showing of Quebec punk bands. This being Some Party, let's dig into that. This year will see  Toronto's [Cancer Bats](http://www.cancerbats.com/) playing their sophomore full-length *Hail Destroyer* in its entirety. The fest has also secured a reunion performance from Calgary's [This Is A Standoff](https://www.facebook.com/thisisastandoff/) and sets from Vancouver singer-songwriter [Jesse Lebourdais](https://jesselebourdais.bandcamp.com/), Winnipeg duo [Mobina Galore](https://www.mobinagalore.com/), Ottawa punk act [The Creeps](https://thecreeps.bandcamp.com/), Burlington three-piece [The Penske File](https://thepenskefileband.bandcamp.com/), and Hamilton rock group [Rules](https://rulesareaband.bandcamp.com). The GTA, in particular, is sending quite a few punk and hardcore acts up the 401, including [Junior Battles](https://www.facebook.com/juniorbattles/), [Pkew Pkew Pkew](https://www.pkewx3.com/), [Teenage X](https://teenage-x.bandcamp.com/), [The Anti-Queens](http://theantiqueens.net/), [Dead Broke](https://deadbrokeband.com/), and [Inhalants](https://huffhuffinhalants.bandcamp.com/).

Montreal is, of course, well represented in a variety of genres. The city scene's sending forth the riff-rock group [Barn Burner](https://barnburner.bandcamp.com/), a reunion of the street-punks the [Brixton Robbers](https://brixtonrobbers.bandcamp.com/), and the heavy, grunge-inspired [Colonel Sun](https://colonelsun.bandcamp.com). The local ska and reggae community's present through [Danny Rebel & The KGB](https://dannyrebelthekgb.bandcamp.com/), [Les Happycuriens](https://leshappycuriens.bandcamp.com/), and [PL Mafia](https://plmafia.bandcamp.com/).
Acoustic trio [Birds of Paradise](https://www.facebook.com/birdsofparadisetrio/) and singer-songwriter [Greg Laraigné](https://greglaraigne.bandcamp.com/) will offer some reprieve from all the blown amps and circle pits. Punk rock's, of course, the main event, with locals [Rock n Roll Television](https://rocknrolltelevision.bandcamp.com/), [Complainers](https://forevercomplaining.bandcamp.com/), [Gilbert & les Amis de Tom](https://lesamisdetom.bandcamp.com/), [Burly Wood](https://burlywood.bandcamp.com), [Oakhearts](https://www.facebook.com/Oakhearts-1720514298253354/), [The Horny Bitches](https://thehornybitches.bandcamp.com/), and [The SkudFux](https://www.theskudfux.com/) tackling the genre from different directions.

The rest of Quebec has a few bands on the current bill as well, including a reunion of the Quebec City hardcore band [Senseless](https://www.facebook.com/pg/Senseless666qc/
). Current HC outfit [BHATT](https://bhattqc.bandcamp.com) (a band with an EP titled *Suicide Penis*) and the melodic hardcore group [Hate It Too](https://hateittoo.bandcamp.com) will also appear.

Pouzza will take place from May 18 to 20 in downtown Montreal.

##Of Note

[Chain Whip](https://chainwhip.bandcamp.com/) is a fast, tough Vancouver punk band with a fast, tough name. The group just released a self-titled EP over at BandCamp, music that's might show up on their debut 7" sometime later this year. The quartet features Josh Nickel of [Fashionism](https://fashionism.bandcamp.com/) on vocals with Joel Butler of [Nervous Talk](https://nervoustalk.bandcamp.com/)/[Corner Boys](https://cornerboys.bandcamp.com) on guitar, Brett Thompson of [Stress Eating](https://stresseating.bandcamp.com/) on bass, and Patrick Bertrand of [Hosehead Records](http://www.hoseheadrecords.ca/)/[Corner Boys](https://cornerboys.bandcamp.com) on drums. Braden DeCorby recorded these songs, which include subtle gems like "Six Day Weekend" and "Let's Bomb East Van."

[Arts & Crafts](https://arts-crafts.ca/) have unveiled another intense, moody song from *Basic Behaviour*, the upcoming LP from Toronto post-punk group [FRIGS](https://frigsmusic.com/). You can hear it below. A couple of weeks ago when the song "Talking Pictures" was released I spoke more [in-depth](https://www.someparty.ca/2018-01-14-talking-pictures/) about this record, so check that out if you haven't yet. I'm pretty excited about this one. It's out on February 23.

The Igloolik hard rock band [Northern Haze](https://www.facebook.com/Inuit.Norther.Haze/) is gearing up to record their second full length, a mere 33 years after their first. The veteran group is planning to build a studio in Iqaluit where they'll work with producer Michael Wojewoda (his credits include Buffy Sainte-Marie's Polaris-winning *Power in the Blood*, and popular records in the 90s by Rheostatics and the Barenaked Ladies). They're looking to cover the expense of setting all this up through a [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/northernhaze).

The band's current line-up features original members Naisana Qamaniq, James Ungalaq, and John Inooya, with James' son, Derek Aqqiaruq, having joined the band as their bassist. Original members Elijah Kunnuk and Kolitalik Inukshuk both died in 2007 (the former from cancer, the latter murdered days later). There's a great recent recap of the band's history over at [BandCamp](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/01/04/northern-haze-feature/). Northern Haze released a collection of various recordings titled *Sinaaktu* in 2012.

[Mint Records](http://www.mintrecs.com/) will be reissuing the 2014 album *Consent* by Vancouver's self-described cold-punk group [Lié](https://lievancouver.bandcamp.com/). The release, which arrives on February 23, comes in the form of a gold cassette in a cardboard sleeve. They're making just 300 of these. The now sold out LP was released by the [That's Cool](https://thatscoolrecords.bandcamp.com/album/tcr-021-consent-lp) label. Mint calls *Consent* "One of the best punk records to ever come out of Vancouver" claiming "it sounds more agitated and incensed than anything White Lung or The Dishrags ever spewed at their polite Canadian audience." If you missed it the first time you can check it out for yourself below.

The debut self-titled debut full length from Moncton punk group [Chiller](https://www.facebook.com/chillerband/) is now streaming online courtesy of [Dirt Cult Records](https://dirtcultrecords.bandcamp.com/) and [New Noise Magazine](https://newnoisemagazine.com/stream-chiller-self-titled/). As discussed here in recent weeks, Chiller is the successor to [Feral Trash](https://feraltrash.bandcamp.com/). It features that band's husband and wife team of Ilisha and Eric, joined by Erin Ewing from Ottawa's [Black Tower](https://blacktower.bandcamp.com/) and Tim Ostler [Mother's Children](https://motherschildren.bandcamp.com/). The new record comes out on February 2 on Dirt Cult in the US and Rockstar in Europe.

Windsor-via-Sackville slacker rock act [Partner](http://partnerband.tumblr.com/) has released a video for their single "Everybody Knows." This song is, of course, the lead track from the band's wonderful debut full-length *In Search of Lost Time*, which came out last fall on [You’ve Changed Records](http://youvechangedrecords.com/). In my little bubble, this was the feel-good-hit-of-the-summer, so to introduce it feels unnecessary. If for some odd reason you've not yet embraced the Partner record, that should be your priority. Colin Medley directed the video.

BandCamp recently published a [retrospective](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/01/22/brave-new-waves-feature/) on the much-loved CBC arts & culture program [Brave New Waves](https://cbcbravenewwaves.bandcamp.com/). The Aaron Carnes-penned piece chronicles the radio show's history from 1984 through the end of its run in 2007. Sessions from the Brave New Waves catalogue are now being assembled and released on vinyl by Jacek Kozlowski of [Artoffact Records](http://artoffact.com/) (11 were released last year, with more on the way for 2018).

Did you miss out on Daniel Romano's limited release digital records *HUMAN TOUCH* and *NERVELESS*? Well, you're out of luck. If you'd rather not relive the disappointment, there's still time to grab a copy of *Silent Rave*, the second full length from Romano's punk group [Ancient Shapes](http://ancientshapes.bandcamp.com). It's being served up on a similar basis, which is to say limited to the end of their tour mid-month. *Silent Rave*, unlike the other records, did in fact get a physical release as a cassette put out by [You've Changed Records](http://youvechangedrecords.com/) last year. Those are pushing $40 on Discogs today.

Calgary duo [Miesha & The Spanks](https://mieshathespanks.bandcamp.com/) premiered their hooky new single "Atmosphere" at [New Noise](https://newnoisemagazine.com/stream-miesha-spanks-atmosphere/) last week. The track will appear on the band's next record, *Girls Girls Girls*, which is due in the Spring. The group features lead vocalist and guitarist Miesha Louie with drummer Sean Hamilton. They worked with Danny Farrant and Paul Rawson in the studio to write and assemble this record. Farrant, cool fact, is the modern-day drummer for the Buzzcocks (he joined them in 2006). *Girls Girls Girls* is a big, crunchy rock record with a lot of swagger. Check this out.

Lethbridge, Alberta's angular post-punk group [WINT](https://wint.bandcamp.com) continues to release music at a prolific rate. The latest from the project, the brainchild of Brandon Saucier, was released this month under the title *Naivety*. The 23 song set was written and recorded entirely in the first week of the year. The new album follows at least five releases from 2017, just in case you wanted to feel unproductive by comparison. I know I do.

Speaking of [Pkew Pkew Pkew](https://www.pkewx3.com/), the band Toronto party-punk group recently performed a Stripped Down Session for [Punks in Vegas](http://www.punksinvegas.com/). The band played acoustic versions of "Before We Go Out Drinking," "The Prime Minister Of Defense," and "Asshole Pandemic" — all of which appeared in studio-form on the band's latest full length for [Royal Mountain](https://www.royalmountainrecords.com/) and SideOneDummy. Having to sit awkwardly in the background of a video like this is pretty much my worse nightmare.

[Spencer Burton](https://www.spencerburtonmusic.com/), the Niagara-based singer-songwriter and former Attack In Black member, recently kicked off a monthly residence at Niagara-on-the-Lake's  [Oast House Brewers](https://oasthousebrewers.com/). Throughout 2018 Burton will be hosting and performing at the farmhouse brewery's Hayloft series of concerts. The next is scheduled for February 18. Burton's a wonderful storyteller on stage, and a local farmer himself, so this is a perfect match. I hope to get out to as many of these as I can.
