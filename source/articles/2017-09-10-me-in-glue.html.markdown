I mention [Tough Age](https://tough-age.bandcamp.com/) quite often on this newsletter, and I blame the set they played at [Ottawa Explosion](http://ottawaexplosion.com/) this year to launch their *Unclean* EP. While I enjoyed the band's 2015 pop-punk LP *I Get The Feeling Central* there's something about the sound they found on *Unclean* that I find completely engrossing. This week the band finally pulled the veil off plans for their follow up, announcing that the eight song full-length *Shame* would arrive on October 20 via [Mint Records](https://www.mintrecs.com/).

The Tough Age of today is a different band that you might remember. The group pulled up stakes in Vancouver and moved to Toronto a few years ago, pairing themselves down to a trio in the process. Guitarist Jarrett Samson, bassist Penny Clark, and drummer Jesse Locke now comprise the band. Their new material has a low-fi indie-pop feel, showing off that [Flying Nun](http://flyingnun.co.nz/) influence that's shown up in more than a few Canadian bands this year. *Shame* was recorded and mixed by [Freelove Fenner](https://freelovefenner.bandcamp.com/)'s Peter Woodford at his Bottle Garden studio in Montreal, with mastering by [Jay Arner](https://jayarner.bandcamp.com/). Toronto comic and graphic artist [Patrick Kyle](http://www.patrickkyle.com/) produced the album's cover art.

Jarrett Samson commented on the new sound and working with Woolford:

>"Part of my goal for this record was to really minimize as a maximization, utilize the new three-piece to explore quieter dynamics, and open up the music. We have the dullest setup in the world — drums, bass, guitar — so I am always impressed by bands who somehow take that and make it sound experimental. On that front, Moss Lime (who Peter also recorded) sprung to mind as a recent band who made so much out of so little, and that was a real inspiration."

Penny Clark added:

>"I was impatient to make an album that reflected how Tough Age has changed. While we were recording, I was in the process of teaching myself how to play bass so my playing on the album is influenced partially by my own tension and concern about coming up inadequate. Stylistically, I tried to honour our previous bass player, Lauren Smith, while still developing my own style. I often visualize nature scenes to help me play so in my head the bass is thundery and soft."

[Consequence of Sound](https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/09/canadian-punks-tough-age-share-the-origins-of-their-new-single-me-in-glue-stream/) premiered the first single from the record as part of their Origins series, which breaks down the influences behind a song. Give that article a read and then go stream "Me In Glue," which features vocals by Clark, a hundred times or so.

##Of Note

The 70th Anniversary celebrations continue at Toronto's [Horseshoe Tavern](http://www.horseshoetavern.com/). A new batch of anniversary shows were announced this week, including two nights of the [Constantines](https://theconstantines.wordpress.com/) on December 15 and 16. That announcement came alongside word of shows from Lisa Leblanc, Fast Romantics, and E Street Band drummer / Conan O'Brien bandleader Max Weinberg. You can find tickets to everything for sale now at the usual outlets, but move quickly.

We're still in the midst of an incredibly busy release season and full-album streams of the closest releases keep cropping up. Over at [CBC Music](http://www.cbcmusic.ca/) you still have a few days left in which to stream [*Ghost Gardens*](http://www.cbcmusic.ca/first-plays/480/first-play-elliott-brood-ghost-gardens) from Hamilton alt-country act [Elliott BROOD](https://www.elliottbrood.com/) as well as [*Pure Mind*](http://www.cbcmusic.ca/first-plays/481/first-play-fake-palms-pure-mind) from Toronto psych-garage group [Fake Palms](https://fakepalms-pleasence.bandcamp.com/). Both records are out Friday, the former is on [Paper Bag Records](http://paperbagrecords.com/) and the latter a joint release between [Buzz](http://buzzrecords.ca/) and [Pleasence Records](http://www.pleasencerecords.com/).

London, Ontario four-piece punk group [Grievances](https://www.facebook.com/grievanceslondon/) premiered a video for the song "Obscurity" at [Punknews](https://www.punknews.org/article/64658/videos-grievances-obscurity-punknews-exclusive) last week. The track will appear on their upcoming debut full-length *Late Bloomers*, which will be released by [Chisel Records](http://chiselrecords.com/product/grievances-late-bloomers-lp-preorder/) in October. Grievances, which features bassist Patrick Briggs, drummer Jesse Fleming, guitarist Brandyn Walkom, and guitarist/vocalist Danny Kidd, describe themselves as "hurling their anxieties at the well fished sea of pop punk to see what sort of monsters will rise." This song in particular features additional vocals by April Romano and Davita of [Never Betters](https://neverbetters.bandcamp.com/).
