The photo in the background of the Some Party header is by [Courtney Michaud](http://www.courtneymichaudphotography.com). It's of [The Beverleys](https://thebeverleys.bandcamp.com/) playing at an [IndoorShoes](http://www.indoorshoesmusic.com) show at the Detour Music Hall in St. Catharines, Ontario on March 28, 2014.

[Jordan Versluis](http://www.jordanversluis.net/) designed the Some Party logo.

I build the Some Party website with [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), an open source static website generator written in Ruby. The site utilizes the functional CSS framework [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) and is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/someparty/someparty).

Thanks to my day-job team at [JMR Logics](https://www.jmr.ca) for the after-hours use of equipment to work on this project.

I owe a similarly enormous debt to Aubin Paul and everyone who volunteers their time to [Punknews.org](https://www.punknews.org) for maintaining the illusion that I'm someone with something to say about independent music.
