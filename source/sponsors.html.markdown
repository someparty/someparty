Some Party will have no more than a single sponsor each month. Sponsors will be showcased below the site header with a logo and short write up, and will be included in each newsletter sent during the month. As a courtesy to the readers, I'll only consider sponsors that fit the overall vibe of the project and I won't be running any banner ads, 3rd party tracking nonsense or anything else I find aesthetically questionable or technically intrusive. [Get in touch](mailto:adam@someparty.ca?subject=Sponsoring Some Party) if you're a record label, venue, band, PR person, festival, brewery, or something in that vein.
