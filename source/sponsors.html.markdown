Some Party is a hobby, and while I'm not opposed to having it generate revenue, it's certainly not a priority. On most months the website and newsletter will run without ads, but if any content is ever the result of a sponsor, I'll label it as such.

Some Party will have no more than a single sponsor each month. Sponsors will be showcased below the site header with a logo and short write up and included in each newsletter sent during their sponsorship period. As a courtesy to the readers, I'll only consider sponsors that fit the overall vibe of the project, and I won't be running any banner ads, 3rd party tracking nonsense or anything else I find aesthetically questionable or technically intrusive.

[Get in touch](mailto:adam@someparty.ca?subject=Sponsoring Some Party) if you're a record label, venue, band, PR person, festival, brewery, dispensary or something in that vein.
