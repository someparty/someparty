Some Party will have a single sponsor per month. Sponsors are showcased below the site header with a logo and short write up, and are included in each newsletter post sent that month. As a courtesy to the readers, I'll only consider sponsors that fit the overall vibe of the project and I won't be running any banner ads, 3rd party tracking nonsense, or anything else I find aesthetically questionable. [Get in touch](mailto:adam@someparty.ca?subject=Sponsoring Some Party) if you're a record label, band, music PR person, festival, brewery, or something in that vein.
